# Executive Summary & Questions
Demographics are an important part to understanding how society functions. We are about to
enter into society after the graduation of college and this topic of demographics has the
potential to affect a lot of parts in our lives such as social norms, job recruitment statistics, and
in general it is fascinating to wonder about how the USA will continue adapting to diversity.
Our project is investigating the change of the distributions of races across the states in the USA
over 10 years, from 2009 to 2019. We are incorporating unsupervised learning to create
clustering models for each race testing several K Means values to answer the question of "what
are the similarities and differences of population proportions of races in all of the states from
2009 to 2019?" What number of clusters most accurately depict our scenario?
